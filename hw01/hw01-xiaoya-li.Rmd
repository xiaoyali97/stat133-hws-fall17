```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#load data file
load("data/nba2017-salary-points.RData")

#list the available objects
ls()
```

####1) Data Preprocessing


- Create a new salary variable measured in millions of dollars, up to 2 decimal digits.

```{r}
salary_in_millions <- salary / 1000000
round(salary_in_millions, 2)
```

- Replace the values "R" by "0", and create a new experience variable as an integer vector.

```{r}
experience_int <- as.vector(replace(experience, experience == "R", "0"), mode = "integer")
typeof(experience_int)
```

- Create a new position variable as an R factor.

```{r}
position_fac <- factor(position, labels = c("center", "power_fwd", "point_guard", 
                                            "small_fwd", "shoot_guard"))
table(position_fac)
```

####2) Scatter plot of Points and Salary
```{r}
plot(points, salary_in_millions, col = rgb(1, 0.5, 0, 0.3),pch = 19,
     ylab = "Salary (in millions)",
     main = "Scatterplot of Points and Salary", cex = 1.5)
```

####3) Correlation between Points and Salary

```{r}
#number of individuals
n <-  length(player)
n
```

```{r}
#mean of variable X(points)
x_mean <- sum(points) / n
x_mean
```

```{r}
#mean of variable Y(salary)
y_mean <- sum(salary_in_millions) / n
y_mean
```

```{r}
#variance of X
var_x <- sum((points - x_mean) ^ 2) / (n - 1)
var_x
```

```{r}
#variance of Y
var_y <- sum((salary_in_millions - y_mean) ^ 2) / (n - 1)
var_y
```

```{r}
#standard deviation of X
sd_x <- sqrt(var_x)
sd_x
```

```{r}
#standard deviation of Y
sd_y <- sqrt(var_y)
sd_y
```

```{r}
#covariance between X and Y
cov_xy <- sum((points - x_mean) * (salary_in_millions - y_mean)) / (n - 1)
cov_xy
```

```{r}
#correlation between X and Y
cor_xy <- cov_xy / (sd_x * sd_y)
cor_xy
```

```{r}
#confirm answer with cor() 
cor(points, salary_in_millions)
```

####4) Simple linear regression
```{r}
#estimated slope of the regression line
slope <- cor_xy * sd_y / sd_x
slope
```

```{r}
#estimated intercept of the regression line
intercept <- y_mean - slope * x_mean
intercept
```

```{r}
#the predicted values of Y
y_pre <- intercept + slope * points
```

- **Summary of statistics of Y-hat.**
```{r}
summary(y_pre)
```

- **What is the regression equation?**  
$\hat{Y}$ = `r intercept` + `r slope` * X 
 

- **How do you interpret the slope coefficient $b_1$ ?**  
If you score one more point, you would expect your salary to raise `r slope` million dollars.


- **How do you interpret the intecept term $b_0$ ?**  
If you score 0 point, you would expect you salary to be `r intercept` million dollars.


- **What is the predicted salary for a player that scores:**  
      - **0 points?** 
      - **100 points?**
      - **500 points?**
      - **1000 points?**
      - **2000 points?**
      
```{r}
intercept + slope * c(0, 100, 500, 1000, 2000)
```


####5) Plotting the regression line

```{r}

plot(points, salary_in_millions, col = rgb(0,0,0,0.3), pch = 19,
    ylab = "Salary (in millions)",
    main = "Regression and Lowess lines", cex = 1.5
)
abline(a = intercept, b = slope, col = "purple", lwd = 3)
lines(lowess(points, salary_in_millions), col = "red", lwd = 3)
text(2400, 20, "regression", col = "purple")  
text(2300, 28, "lowess", col = "red")


```

####6) Regression residuals and Coefficient of Determination $R^2$

```{r}
#the vector of residuals (display only its summary() statistics)
residuals_e <- salary_in_millions - y_pre
summary(residuals_e)
```

```{r}
#the Residual Sum of Squares
RSS <- sum(residuals_e ^ 2)
RSS
```

```{r}
#the Total Sum of Squares
TSS <- sum((salary_in_millions - y_mean) ^ 2)
TSS
```

```{r}
#the coefficient of determination R^2
coeffi_of_deter <- 1 - RSS / TSS
coeffi_of_deter
```

####7) Exploring Position and Experience

```{r}
plot(experience_int, salary_in_millions, xlab = "Year of experience",
     ylab = "Salary (in millions)", main = "Scatterplot with lowess smooth",
     col = rgb(0,0,0,0.3), pch = 16, cex = 1.5)
lines(lowess(experience_int, salary_in_millions), col = "red", lwd = 3)

```

*description: The scatterplot shows a non-linear, weak association between year of experience and salary. The graph is bell-shaped center around 6 years of experience, with several outliers spread out above, especially after 10 years experience. *

- **From the scatterplots, does Experience seem to be related with Salary?**  
From the scatterplots, players who have less than 4 years experience earn less salary in general. However, after that, there's no linear association between experience and salary, because a longer year of experience doesn't associate with higher salaries and also the players who have experience between 4 to 13 have a widespread salary range. 

```{r fig.width= 5, fig.height= 5}
library(scatterplot3d)
scatterplot3d(points, experience_int, salary_in_millions,
              ylab = "experience", zlab = "Salary",main = "3D Scatterplot",
              pch = 19, color = rgb(1, 0.5, 0, 0.3) )
```

*description: The 3D scatterplot shows a non-linear association among salary, points, and experience. Most of the scatter are located at the lower left corner, representing the majority of players have a low salary, less than 500 points and less than 5 years experience.*


```{r}
boxplot(salary_in_millions ~ position_fac)
```

*description: The median for 5 different positions are almost at the same level, so does their distribution, skew to the right. The 5 box plots are all comparatively the same in Inter-quartile range, with position center having a highest Upper quartile. Except for position center, all other 4 box have outliers. *

- **From the boxplot, does Position seem to be related with Salary?**  
On average, players in different position seems to have the same salary. But when we comparing the high-income portion, players in position center have a higher salary than other positions, with the position in point guard the lowest. 

####8) Comments and Reflections

- **What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?**  
Give detail description of the plots.

- **Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?**  
Yes, I did. I need help on some plots function as well as how to describe the plots well. My GSI Xiaoqi helped me.

- **How much time did it take to complete this HW?**  
Around 4 hours.

- **What was the most time consuming part?**  
Learn how to use R to generate a detailed graph. 

- **Was there anything exciting? Something that you feel proud of? (Don't be shy, we won't tell anyone).**  
Figure out how to customize the circle in the scatter plot, filling it with different colors and making it transparent.
