Quadratic Equation
==================

<br>

> A general formula for ****quadratic equation**** is :
> *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
>  where `x` represents an **unknown**, and `a`, `b`, and `c` represent **known numbers** such that `a` is not equal to 0. If `a = 0`, then the equation is **linear**, not quadratic. The numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the **quadratic coefficient**, the **linear coefficient** and the **constant** or **free term**.

<br>

> A quadratic formula for the ****roots of the general quadratic equation**** is :
> $$  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Comments and Reflections
========================

<br>

*- What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?*
To remember all the function and method.

*- What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?*
Writing some simple expression.

*- Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?*
Yes. Markdown is very neat, but it's not powerful enough that sometimes you need to mix with other lanuage to accomplish your goal.

*- How much time did it take to complete this HW?*
Around 3 hours.

*- What was the most time consuming part?*
Formatting all the text.
