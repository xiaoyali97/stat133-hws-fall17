#Quadratic Equation

<br>

> A general formula for **_*quadratic equation*_** is : 
\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0  \]
> where `x` represents an **unknown**, and `a`, `b`, and `c` represent **known  numbers** such that `a` is not equal to 0. If `a = 0`, then the equation is **linear**, not quadratic. The numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the **quadratic coefficient**, the **linear coefficient** and the **constant** or **free term**.

<br>

> A quadratic formula for the **_*roots of the general quadratic equation*_** is :
\[  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]
