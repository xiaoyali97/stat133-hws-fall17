```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### 1) Create a data dictionary

### 2) Import the data in R

```{r}
#using read.csv() to import data
col_types <- c(
  'character', 'character', 'factor','character','double',
  'integer', 'integer','integer', 'integer', 'integer', 'integer', 'integer', 'integer', 'integer',
  'integer','integer','integer', 'integer','integer', 'integer', 'integer', 'integer', 'integer',  'integer'
)

nba_dat <- read.csv('data/nba2017-player-statistics.csv', header = TRUE, colClasses = col_types)

str(nba_dat)
```

```{r}
#using read_csv() to import data
library(readr)
nba_dat <- read_csv('data/nba2017-player-statistics.csv', col_names = TRUE, 
                    col_types = cols(Player = col_character(), Team = col_character(), 
                                  Position = col_factor(c('C', 'PF', 'PG','SF', 'SG')),
                                  Salary = col_double())
                    )
str(nba_dat)

```

### 3) Right after importing the data

```{r}
nba_dat$Experience[nba_dat$Experience == 'R'] <- '0'
nba_dat$Experience <- as.integer(nba_dat$Experience)
```

### 4) Performance of players

To compute **EFF**, you will have to add the following variables to your data frame:
    - **Missed_FG** (missed field goals)
    - **Missed_FT** (missed free throws)
    - **PTS** (total points)
    - **REB** (total rebounds: offensive and defensive)
    - **MPG** (minutes per game; NOT to be used when calculating **EFF**)

```{r}
nba_dat$Missed_FG <- nba_dat$FGA - nba_dat$FGM
nba_dat$Missed_FT <- nba_dat$FTA - nba_dat$FTM
nba_dat$PTS <- nba_dat$Points2 * 2 + nba_dat$Points3 * 3 + nba_dat$FTM * 1 
nba_dat$REB <- nba_dat$OREB + nba_dat$DREB
nba_dat$MPG <- nba_dat$MIN / nba_dat$GP
```

Once you have all the necessary statistics, add a variable **EFF** to the data frame using the
formula provided above.

```{r}
nba_dat$EFF <- (nba_dat$PTS + nba_dat$REB + nba_dat$AST + nba_dat$STL + nba_dat$BLK - 
                  nba_dat$Missed_FG - nba_dat$Missed_FT - nba_dat$TO) / nba_dat$GP
```

Compute summary statistics for **EFF** and confirm that you have the following results, as well
as a similar histogram:

```{r}
summary(nba_dat$EFF)
hist(nba_dat$EFF, main = "Histogram of Efficiency (EFF)", xlab = "EFF", col = "grey")
```

- Display the player name, team, salary, and EFF value of the top-10 players by EFF in
decreasing order (display this information in a data frame).

```{r}
nba_dat[order(nba_dat$EFF, decreasing = TRUE),][1:10, c("Player", "Team", "Salary", "EFF")]
```

- Provide the names of the players that have a negative EFF.

```{r}
nba_dat[nba_dat$EFF < 0, ]$Player
```

- Use the function cor() to compute the correlation coefficients between EFF and all the
variables used in the EFF formula.  
Notice that Missed_FG, Missed_FT, and TO contribute negatively to EFF, so make
sure to take into account this negative association when calculating the correlation
coefficients.


```{r}

cor_coefficients <- c(
  PTS = cor(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$PTS),
  REB = cor(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$REB),
  AST = cor(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$AST),
  STL = cor(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$STL),
  BLK = cor(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$BLK),
  Missed_FT = cor(nba_dat$EFF, -nba_dat$Missed_FT),
  Missed_FG = cor(nba_dat$EFF, -nba_dat$Missed_FG),
  TO = cor(nba_dat$EFF, -nba_dat$TO)
)
```

- Display the computed correlations in descending order, either in a vector or a data
frame. And create a barchart with the correlations (bars in decreasing order) like the
one below.
```{r}
cor_coefficients <- cor_coefficients[order(cor_coefficients, decreasing = TRUE)]
cor_coefficients

barplot(cor_coefficients, main = "Correlations between Player Stats and EFF",
        col = c("grey", "orange")[(cor_coefficients > 0) + 1] , border = FALSE, 
        cex.names = 0.7, ylim=c(-1,1)
        )
abline(h = 0)
```

### 5) Efficiency and Salary

Once you've calculated the Efficiency statistic, produce a scatterplot between Efficiency
(x-axis) and Salary (y-axis), including a lowess smooth line (locally weighted scatterplot
smoothing). 

```{r}
#scatterplot between Efficiency and Salary
plot(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$Salary, pch = 16, col = rgb(1, 0.5, 0, 0.3),
     main = "Scatterplot of Efficiency and Salary", xlab = "EFF", ylab = "Salary")
#lowess smooth line
lines(lowess(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$Salary), lwd = 3, col = rgb(1,0,0.5))
text(33, 25000000, labels = "lowess", col = rgb(1,0,0.5))

```

Also, compute the linear correlation coefficient between them.

```{r}
cor(nba_dat$EFF, nba_dat$Salary)
```

What can you say about the relationship between these two variables?  
<span style="color:blue"> Based on the scatterplot and the linear correlation coefficient, there's a positive association between **EFF** and **Salary**. </span>


Because rookie players (and other low-experience players) seem to form a different universe of players, let's see what's happening with those individuals with a more "solid" or more established trajectory in the NBA.  
    - Taking into account the column MPG (minutes per game) select those players that have an MPG value of 20 or more minutes per game.
    - Create a data frame `players2` with these players.
    
```{r}
players2 <- nba_dat[nba_dat$MPG >= 20,]
players2
```

  - Use this data frame to create a scatterplot between Efficiency and Salary, including a lowess smooth line.
    
```{r}
#scatterplot
plot(players2$EFF, players2$Salary, main = "more established players' scatterplot of EEF and Salary",
     xlab = "EEF", ylab = "Salary", pch = 16, col = rgb(1,0,1, 0.3))
#lowess smooth line
lines(lowess(players2$EFF, players2$Salary), col = rgb(0,0.5,1), lwd = 3)
text(32, 21000000, labels = "lowess",col = rgb(0,0.5,1))
```

   - Compute the linear correlation coefficient between these variables.
    
```{r}
cor(players2$EFF, players2$Salary)
```

  - What can you say about the relationship between these two variables for the set of "more established players"?  
   <span style="color:blue"> Based on the scatterplot and linear correlation coefficient, there's still a positive association between **EFF** and **Salary**, but with a more shallow slope. </span>
    
### 6) Comments and Reflections 


- What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?  
<span style="color:blue"> Make correctly use different data type. For example, sometimes you can not generate a plot of a dataframe directly, which needs to be converted to a vector first. </span>

- What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class/lab?  
<span style="color:blue"> Calculation part. </span>

- Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help?  
<span style="color:blue"> Yes. I look up resource online. </span>

- How much time did it take to complete this HW?  
<span style="color:blue"> Around 3 hours. </span>

- What was the most time consuming part?  
<span style="color:blue"> Try to figure out how to convert a dataframe into the data type that I want. </span>

- Was there anything exciting? Something that you feel proud of?  
<span style="color:blue"> I'm more familiar with ploting data. </span>

- Was there anything that you did not understand? or fully grasped?  
<span style="color:blue"> How to write a professional dictionary for a data file. </span>
