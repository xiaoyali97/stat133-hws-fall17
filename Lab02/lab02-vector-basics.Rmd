## Getting the Data File

In this lab, you are going to work with a handful of variables about NBA players
from the regular season 2016-2017:

- `player`: name of the player.
- `team`: team name abbreviation.
- `position`: player position.
- `salary`: salary (in dollars).
- `points`: total scored points.
- `points1`: number of free throws, worth 1 point each.
- `points2`: number of 2-point field goals, worth 2 points each.
- `points3`: number of 3-point field goals, worth 3 points each.

The data is in the file `nba2017-salary-points.RData`, located in the `data/` folder of this github repository.
The original source of the data is the website [www.basketball-reference.com](http://www.basketball-reference.com/)

Open a new session in Rstudio, and make sure you have a clean workspace by
typing this command on the console:

```r
# remove existing objects
rm(list = ls())
```

You can download the `.RData` file to your working directory, and then `load()` 
it with the code below. Do NOT include these commands in your source Rmd file; 
simply type them directly on the console:

```{r, eval = F}
# download RData file into your working directory
rdata <- "https://github.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-fall-2017/raw/master/data/nba2017-salary-points.RData"
download.file(url = rdata, destfile = 'nba2017-salary-points.RData')
```


### What's happening in the code above?

The function `download.file()` allows you to download any type of file from 
the Web. In this case you are downloading the file called 
`nba2017-salary-points.RData` 
which is located in the github repository of the course. This file is a binary 
file. To be more precise, the file extension `.RData` is the default extension 
used by R for its binary native format.

Where does the file get downloaded? Bby default, the file `nba2017-salary-points.RData` 
gets downloaded to your __working directory__. If you are curious about what 
is the current 
directory to which R is paying attention to, simply type the function 
`getwd()`---which stands for _get the working directory_.

If you want to specify a specific location for the downloaded file, then modify
the `destfile` parameter. For instance, if you are using Mac, and you want the
file to be downloaded to your desktop, you can use:

```{r, eval = F}
# download RData file to your Desktop (assuming you use Mac)
rdata <- "https://github.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-fall-2017/raw/master/data/nba2017-salary-points.RData"
download.file(url = rdata, destfile = '~/Desktop/nba2017-salary-points.RData')
```


### Loading the data file

To load or import the contents of the binary file into your R session you use `load()`. 
This function allows you to import R binary files. This time, include the code
below in your `Rmd` file:

```{r}
# load data in your R session

load('~/nba2017-salary-points.RData')
#head(player)
```

Note: the code above will only work as long as your `Rmd` file lives in the 
same directory of the `.RData` file. So far I'm assuming that you have both 
files in the working directory. If you run into problems, ask the GSI or any
of the lab assistants.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# load data in your R session
#load('../data/nba2017-salary-points.RData')
```

Once you imported (or loaded) the data, use the function `ls()` which allows 
you to __list__ all the available R objects:

```r
# list the available objects with ls()
ls()
```

Check that the following objects are available in your session:

- `player`
- `team`
- `position`
- `salary`
- `points`


### About `.RData` files

Most of the data sets you are going to be
working with in real life are going to be stored in some sort of text file. 
So you probably won't be handling many R binary files (i.e. `.RData` files). 
However, R binary files are an interesting option for saving intermediate 
results, and/or for saving R objects (as R objects).



### Inspecting the data objects

Once you have some data objects to work with, the first step is to
inspect some of their characteristics. R has various functions that
allow you to examine objects: 

- `typeof()` type of storage of any object
- `class()` gives you the class of the object
- `str()` displays the structure of an object in a compact way
- `mode()` gives the data type (as used in R)
- `object.size()` gives an estimate of the memory space used by an object
- `length()` gives the length (i.e. number of elements)
- `head()` take a peek at the first elements
- `tail()` take a peek at the last elements
- `summary()` shows a summary of a given object

Your turn. Find out what is the class of each of the objects `player`, `team`, etc:

```{r}
# your code here
```

Now use `length()`, `head()`, `tail()`, and `summary()` to start exploring
the content of the objects:

```{r}
# your code here
```

Do all the objects have the same length?


## Vectors in R

Vectors are the most basic type of data structures in R. Learning how to
manipulate data structures in R requires you to start learning 
how to manipulate vectors.

How do you know if any of the loaded objects is a vector? Using `class()` does 
not explicitly tell you whether an R object is a vector or not. A more explicit 
way to check if `player` or `position` are vectors is with the function 
`is.vector()`.

```{r}
# check whether the loaded objects are vectors
```

Remember that R vectors are __atomic structures__, which is just the fancy
name to indicate that all the elements of a vector must be of the same type,
either all numbers, all characters, or all logical values. To test if an object
is _atomic_, i.e. has all its elements of the same type, use `is.atomic()`

```{r}
# check whether the loaded objects are atomic objects
```

How do you know that a given vector is of a certain data type? One function 
to answer this question is `typeof()`

```{r}
typeof(player)
typeof(position)
typeof(points)
```

You should know that among the R community, most useRs don't talk about _types_.
Instead, because of historical reasons related to the S language, we talk about 
_modes_.


## Manipulating Vectors: Subsetting

Subsetting refers to extracting elements of a vector (or another R object). 
To do so, you use what is known as __bracket notation__. This implies using 
(square) brackets `[ ]` to get access to the elements of a vector, for 
instance:

```r
# first element of 'player'
player[1]

# first five elements of 'player'
player[1:5]
```

What type of things can you specify inside the brackets? Basically:

- numeric vectors
- logical vectors (the length of the logical vector must match the length
of the vector to be subset)
- character vectors (if the elements have names)


### Subsetting with Numeric Indices

Here are some subsetting examples using a numeric vector inside the 
brackets:

```r
# fifth element of 'player'
player[5]

# numeric range
player[2:8]

# numeric vector
player[c(1, 3, 5, 7)]

# different order
player[c(20, 9, 10, 50)]

# third element (four times)
player[rep(3, 4)]
```

Subset the first four players:

```{r}
four <- player[1:4]
```

Now try these. What happens if you specify: 

- an index of zero: `four[0]`?
- a negative index: `four[-1]`?
- various negative indices: `four[-c(1,2,3)]`?
- an index greater than the length of the vector: `four[5]`?
- repeated indices: `four[c(1,2,2,3,3,3)]`?

Often, you will need to generate vectors of numeric sequences, like the first five elements `1:5`, or from the first till the last element `1:length(player)`. R provides the colon operator `:`, and the functions `seq()`, and `rep()` to create various types of sequences.

Figure out how to use `seq()`, `rep()` to extract:

- all the even elements in `player`
- all the odd elements in `salary`
- all multiples of 5 (e.g. 5, 10, 15, etc) of `team`
- elements in positions 10, 20, 30, 40, etc of `points`
- all the even elements in `team` but this time in reverse order


### Subsetting with Logical Indices

Logical subsetting involves using a logical vector inside the brackets.
Learning about _logical subsetting_ is a fundamental survival skill. 
This kind of subsetting is __very powerful__ because it allows you to 
extract elements based on some logical condition. 

Here's a toy example of logical subsetting:

```{r}
# dummy vector
a <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)

# logical subsetting
a[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

Logical subsetting occurs when the vector of indices that you pass inside the 
brackets is a logical vector.

To do logical subsetting, the vector that you put inside the brackets,
should match the length of the manipulated vector. If you pass a shorter 
vector inside brackets, R will apply its recycling rules.

Notice that the elements of the vector that are subset are those which match 
the logical value `TRUE`.

```r
# your turn
four[c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)]
four[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
four[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
four[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
four[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]

# recycling
four[TRUE]
four[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
```

When subsetting a vector logically, most of the times you won't really be 
providing an explicit vector of `TRUE`'s and `FALSE`s. Just imagine having a 
vector of 100 or 1000 or 1000000 elements, and trying to do logical subsetting 
by manually creating a logical vector of the same length. 
That would be very boring. Instead, you will be 
providing a logical condition or a comparison operation that returns a logical 
vector.

A __comparison operation__ occurs when you use comparison operators such as: 

- `>` greater than
- `>=` greater than or equal
- `<` less than
- `<=` less than or equal
- `==` equal
- `!=` different

```{r}
# elements greater than 6
a > 6

# elements different from 6
a != 6
```

Notice that a comparison operation always returns a logical vector.
Here's how you actually extract the values of a vector based on logical indexing:

```{r}
points_four <- points[1:4]

# elements greater than 100
points_four[points_four > 100]

# elements less than 100
points_four[points_four < 100]

# elements less than or equal to 10
points_four[points_four <= 10]

# elements different from 10
points_four[points_four != 10]
```

In addition to using comparison operators, you can also use __logical operators__ to
produce a logical vector. The most common type of logical operators are:

- `&` AND
- `|` OR
- `!` negation

Run the following commands to see what R does:

```r
# AND
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
FALSE & FALSE

# OR
TRUE | TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | FALSE

# NOT
!TRUE
!FALSE
```

Logical operators allow you to combine several comparisons:

```r
# players of Golden State (GSW)
player[team == 'GSW']

# name of players with salaries greater than 20 million dollars
player[salary > 20000000]

# name of players with scored points between 1000 and 1200 (exclusive)
player[points > 1000 & points < 1200]
```


### Your turn

Write commands, using bracket notation, to answer the following questions (you may need to use `min()`, `max()`, `which()`, 
`which.min()`, `which.max()`):

```{r}
# players in position Center, of Warriors (GSW)


# players of both GSW (warriors) and LAL (lakers)


# players in positions Shooting Guard and Point Guards, of Lakers (LAL) 


# subset Small Forwards of GSW and LAL


# name of the player with largest salary


# name of the player with smallest salary


# name of the player with largest number of points


# salary of the player with largest number of points


# largest salary of all Centers


# team of the player with the largest number of points


# name of the player with the largest number of 3-pointers



```


### Subsetting with Character Vectors

A third type of subsetting involves passing a character vector inside brackets.
When you do this, the characters are supposed to be names of the manipulated
vector.

None of the vectors `player`, `position`, `points`, and `salary` have names.
You can confirm that with the `names()` function applied on any of the vectors:

```r
names(player)
```

Create a vector `warriors_player` by selecting the players of `team == 'GSW'`; 
then create a vector `warriors_salary` with their salaries, and another
vector `warriors_points` with their `points`. 
Assign `warriors_player` as the names of `warriors_salary`.

```r
# create warriors_player


# create warriors_salary


# create warriors_points


```

You should have a vector `warriors_salary` with named elements. Now you can use
character subsetting:

```r
warriors_salary["Andre Iguodala"]

warriors_salary[c("Stephen Curry", "Kevin Durant")]
```


### Some plotting

Use the function `plot()` to make a scatterplot of `points` and `salary`

```r
plot(points, salary)
```

Keep in mind that `plot()` is a generic function. This means that the behavior
of `plot()` depends on the type of input. When you pass two numeric vectors,
`plot()` will attempt to create a scatter plot.

Looking at the generated plot, can you see any issues?

To get a better display of the scatterplot, let's create two vectors
`log_points` and `log_salary` by transforming `points` and `salary` with the 
logarithm function `log()`

```r
log_points <- log(points)
log_salary <- log(salary)
```

Make another scatterplot but now use the log-transformed vectors:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(log_points, log_salary)
```

To add the names of the players in the plot, you can use the low-level graphing
function `text()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(log_points, log_salary)
text(log_points, log_salary, labels = player)
```

Now we have another problem. The labels in the plot are very messy. A quick
and dirty fix is to use `abbreviate()` to shorten the displayed names:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(log_points, log_salary)
text(log_points, log_salary, labels = abbreviate(player))
```

__Your Turn__: create a scatterplot of points and salary for the Warriors (GSW),
displaying the names of the players. Generate two scatterplots, one with raw
values (original scale, and another plot with log-transformations).


## Vectorization

When you create the vectors `log_points <- log(points)` and 
`log_salary <- log(salary)`, what you're doing is applying a function to a 
vector, which in turn acts on all elements of the vector.

This is called __Vectorization__ in R parlance. Most functions that operate 
with vectors in R are __vectorized__ functions. This means that an action 
is applied to all elements of the vector without the need to explicitly type 
commands to traverse all the elements.

In many other programming languages, you would have to use a set of commands 
to loop over each element of a vector (or list of numbers) to transform them. 
But not in R. 

Another example of vectorization would be the calculation of the square root 
of all the elements in `points` and `salary`:

```r
sqrt(points)
sqrt(salary)
```


### Why should you care about vectorization?

If you are new to programming, learning about R's vectorization will be very
natural (you won't stop to think about it too much). If you have some previous
programming experience in other languages (e.g. C, python, perl), you know 
that vectorization does not tend to be a native thing.

Vectorization is essential in R. It saves you from typing many lines of code,
and you will exploit vectorization with other useful functions known as the 
_apply_ family functions (we'll talk about them later in the course).



## Recycling

Closely related with the concept of _vectorization_ we have the notion of
__Recycling__. To explain _recycling_ let's see an example.

`salary` is given in dollars, but what if you need to
obtain the salaries in millions of dollars?. Create a new vector
`salary_millions` with the converted values in millions of dollars. 

```{r}
# your code here
```

Take the values in `height`, given in inches, to create a new vector 
`height_cms` that shows the values in centimeters; use the conversion of 
1 inch = 2.54 centimeters.

```{r}
# your code here
```

What you just did (assuming that you did things correctly) is called 
__Recycling__. To understand this concept, you need to remember that R does 
not have a data structure for scalars (single numbers). Scalars are in reality
vectors of length 1.

Converting square kms to square miles requires this operation: `area * 0.836`.
Although it may not be obvious, we are multiplying two vectors: `area` and 
`0.836`. Moreover (and more important) __we are multiplying two vectors of 
different lengths!__. So how does R know what to do in this cases?

Well, R uses the __recycling rule__, which takes the shorter vector (in this
case `0.386`) and recycles its elements to form a temporary vector that matches
the length of the longer vector (i.e. `area`).


### Another recycling example

Here's another example of recycling. Heights of elements in an odd number 
position will be transformed to cms; heights of elements in an even 
number position will be transformed to meters:

```r
units <- c(2.54, 0.0254)
mix_height <- height * units
```

The elements of `units` are recycled and repeated as many times as elements
in `height`. The previous command is equivalent to this:

```r
new_units <- rep(c(2.54, 0.0254), length.out = length(height))
height * new_units
```


-----

## Factors

As mentioned before, vectors are the most essential type of data structure
in R. They are _atomic_ structures (can contain only one type of data):
integers, real numbers, logical values, characters, complex numbers.

Related to vectors, there is another important data structure in R called
__factor__. Factors are data structures exclusively designed to handle 
categorical data.

The object `team` is an R factor. You can confirm this by using `is.factor()`
or `class()`

```{r}
is.factor(team)
```


### Creating Factors

Use `factor()` to create an object `position_fac` by converting `position` into a factor:

```{r}
position_fac <- factor(position)
```

If you have a factor, you can invoke `table()` to get a table with the 
frequencies (i.e. counts) of the factor categories or _levels_:

```{r}
table(position_fac)
```



### Manipulating Factors

Because factors are internally stored as integers, you can manipulate factors
as any other vector:

```{r}
position_fac[1:5]
```

Practice manipulating `position_fac` to get:

```r
# positions of Warriors


# positions of players with salaries > 15 millions


# frequencies (counts) of positions with salaries > 15 millions


# relative frequencies (proportions) of 'SG' (Shooting Guards) in each team


#
```

### More Plots

Let's go back to the scatterplot of `points` and `salary`

```r
plot(points, salary)
```

But now use your factor `position_fac` to add some color to the dots in the
scatterplot. Pass the factor to the `col = ` parameter inside `plot()`

```{r}
# your colored scatterplot

```

Experiment with other `plot()` arguments like the _point character_ `pch =`, 
the _size of dots_ with the parameter `cex = `, the axes labels `xlab` and 
`ylab` and so on.
